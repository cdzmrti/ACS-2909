/* Memory Concept */

let number1 = null; // number1 is the variable name which correspond to a location in the computer's memory
// you can imagin number1 as a box in a specific location
//Each variable has name, type, and value
//There are four data types: string, number, boolean, and object.
// Additionally, there are two types to convey no data with: undefined and null.
console.log("number1 =", number1);
number1 = 9; // 9 is the value, type is number
console.log("number1 =", number1);

/* Static vs dynamic typed languages */
// Java, C, C++, C#, Ada, Pascal, ... are statically typed programming languages
//(do require variables to have a declared type before they can be used in a script)

// JavaScript, Objective-C, PHP, Python, ... are dynamically typed programming languages
//do NOT require you to declare the  types of your variables before using them
// =====>  JavaScript is referred to as a loosely typed language.
